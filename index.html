    <h2> What scouting is <img src="..\BoyScoutWebPage\images\square_knot.gif" alt="image"> </h2>

    <p class="mission">Have you ever cooked over a open fire? Do you know how to save a life?
        Can you survive in the wilderness? Have you ever lived in a igloo for a weekend? 
        Do you know how to build a bridge out of a few logs and some rope? 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Scouts in Troop 181 can do all these things...and more! They camp, hike, and fish in the 
        great outdoors. Weekend camping trips, white water rafting, hiking expeditions, wilderness
        survival, week long camping at Boy Scout Summer Camp, and much more! Not only that, but in Boy
        Scout Troop 181, the boys do all the planning and run these adventures, with just a little
        guidance from the adult leaders.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Get out into the woods, Boy Scouting takes place outdoors. It is here that the skills and
        activities practiced at troop meetings become real. Being close to nature helps you gain an 
        appreciation for God's handiwork and out place in it. The outdoors is where the Boy Scouts learn
        about ecology and practice conservation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Learn and do things that most guy's dont. Join Troop 181, and be part of the adventure.
        Don't just watch, do.
